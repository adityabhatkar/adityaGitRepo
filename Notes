Sorting:
ref: http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/15154287/2
Java prefers using merge sort instead of quick sort-
1. Merge sort is stable.
  Relative positions  of elements are maintained of elements with equal values.
  This is helpful in scenarios such as sorting email list by name and then date.
  Stability is a non issue for primitive data types.  
  
2. Quick sort gives quadratic time complexities.

However Quick sort is inplace requires only O(lg (n)) extra memory (for method call stack)
Merge sort needs O(n) extra space.
